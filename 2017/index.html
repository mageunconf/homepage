					<h2>Our sponsors</h2>
				
					<p>We'd like to say a special and loud "Thank You!" to our main sponsors, who decided to support the Magento community. They make it possible to have such a great event:
					<ul id="sponsors">

				<h2>What is an unConference?</h2>
			
				<p>Someone said: “An unConference is all about people” and Judith Andresen, my UnConference mentor, said: “An
					unConference makes the coffee break a principle”. We have nothing further to add.</p>
			
				<p>If you want to know more, here are the details. There are two important parts:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>There are no speakers. You decide what you want to hear about and you bring the content.</li>
					<li>We'll have a lot coffee breaks. More precisely, the plan is to have a 45min session, followed by a 30min coffee
						break.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>No speakers</h3>
			
				<p>We meet in the morning, collect contributions (talks, workshops, tutorials or discussions you can give or
					moderate) and interests (things you'd like to hear about, learn or check out).</p>
			
				<p>All topics are presented in a few sentences and we merge topics which are similar, so it may happen that two
					contributions end in one session and we have great discussions.</p>
			
				<p>All attendees have two votes to give feedback on what they are interested in. The sessions with the most votes win
					and the time table is built from them.</p>
			
				<p>Then you will have a great time in the sessions.</p>
			
				<h3>Coffee breaks</h3>
			
				<p>We'll take care of the time and bring you all together for 45 minutes, so you can discuss the session you've just
					attended, talk about problems or ideas you have about Magento, or just meet friends.</p>

				<h2>Our Motivation</h2>
			
				<img src="../img/groupimage-orga-team.jpg" alt="Orga Team of Mage UC 2015" width="100%"/>
				<p><small>Our Team Carmen, Sonja, Fabian, Rico, and Tobias (not in the picture: Vinai)</small></p>
				
			
				<p>A long time ago, two agencies started the idea of developing modules for the (German) magento community:
					FlagBit and ITABS. The idea was to give something back to the community, so FireGento was founded as a group of
					agencies and freelancers to develop open source modules. Today, we maintain one of the most important modules
					for the German market: FireGento MageSetup. We organize hackathons in Germany and Switzerland, and help other
					conference organizers around the world with hackathons. In addition, a lot modules were developed by
					our members or friends on hackathons - check them out.</p>
			
				<p>Because two of our members are part of the PHP unConference Europe, we thought it's a good idea to do a
					Magento specific UnConference, since this format gives more room for discussion, knowledge transfer and
					networking than any other conference format that we know.</p>
			
				<h3>Team</h3>
			
				<p>A big thank you to our team. Rico Neitzel and Tobias Klose who take care of all the marketing
					stuff, website and paper stuff. Vinai Kopp, our connection to the community and our gofer. Sonja Riesterer and Carmen Bremen for their social media engagement and Pia Bodden as our proof
					reader of all texts. We'd also like to give a shout out to Fabian Blechschmidt, who takes care of the venue and all the local stuff in Berlin.</p>
