            <p>We'd like to say a special and loud "Thank You!" to our main sponsors, who decided to support the Magento

        <h2>The location</h2>

        <p>In 2017, we move the event from Berlin to Cologne. With Startplatz, a start-up incubator and coworking space,
            we have found a great location to cater all of our needs: Wi-Fi, coffee, rooms of different sizes, easily
            accessable with public transport and a spirit that goes well with our event.</p>

        <p>Is it the initial letter or their modern design? Whatever it is, German Magento developers have taken a
            liking to Motel One hotels. So we have reserved as many rooms as possible to gather you all at <a
                    href="http://www.motel-one.com/de/hotels/koeln/koeln-mediapark/">Motel One Köln Mediapark</a>. Just
            say the magic password <strong>Magento</strong> when you <a href="mailto:koeln-mediapark@motel-one.com">email</a>
            or call them to book a room.<br/>
            The hotel is just across the road from the event location.</p>
        <p>If breakfast is the most important meal of the day for you, please consider booking breakfast at the
            hotel.</p>

        <h2>What is an unConference?</h2>

        <p>Someone once said: “An unConference is all about people.” Judith Andresen, Fabian's mentor for anything
            regarding UnConferences, said that an
            unConference makes the coffee break a principle. There is nothing to add.</p>

        <p>Okay, maybe just let us add two more aspects that shape this event:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>There are no previously selected speakers. On the day of the event, you decide what you are interested
                in and what you would like to talk about.
            </li>
            <li>We will have a lot coffee breaks. More precisely, the plan is to have a 45min session, followed by a
                30min coffee
                break.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>No speakers</h3>

        <p>We meet in the morning, collect contributions (talks, workshops, tutorials or discussions you can offer or
            moderate) and interests (topics you would like to hear about, learn or check out).</p>

        <p>All topics are presented in a few sentences. If topics overlap or complement one another, we merge them, so
            it may happen that two
            contributions result in one session. These merges are often a great starting point for a discussion.</p>

        <p>All attendees have two votes to give feedback on what they are interested in. The sessions with the most
            votes are selected to fill our time table.</p>

        <h3>Coffee breaks</h3>

        <p>We keep an eye on the clock and make sure that after each 45min session, we bring you all together for 30
            minutes, so you can discuss the session you've just
            attended, talk about issues or ideas you have about Magento, drink a cup of coffee or have a little
            chit-chat with new and old friends.</p>

        <h2>Our Motivation</h2>

        <img src="../img/groupimage-orga-team.jpg" alt="Orga Team of Mage UC 2015" width="100%"/>
        <p>
            <small>Our Team Carmen, Sonja, Fabian, Rico, and Tobias (not in the picture: Vinai)</small>
        </p>


        <p>It's story time! A long time ago, two agencies started the idea of developing modules for the (German)
            Magento community:
            FlagBit and ITABS. The purpose was to give something back to the community, so the society FireGento was
            founded, formed by a group of
            agencies and freelancers to develop open source modules. Today, we maintain one of the most important
            modules
            for the German Magento market: FireGento MageSetup. We organize hackathons in Germany and Switzerland, and
            help other
            conference organizers around the world with hackathons. In addition, many more modules were developed by
            our members and friends on hackathons - check them out.</p>

        <p>Because two of our members are part of the PHP unConference Europe and really enjoy these events, we thought
            it's a good idea to do a
            Magento specific UnConference, since this format offers more room for discussion, knowledge transfer and
            networking than any other conference format we know.</p>

        <h3>Team</h3>

        <p>A big thank you to our team. Rico Neitzel and Tobias Klose who take care of all the marketing
            stuff, website and paper stuff. Vinai Kopp, our connection to the community and our gofer. Sonja Riesterer
            and Carmen Bremen for their social media engagement and Pia Bodden as our proof
            reader of all texts. We'd also like to give a shout out to Fabian Blechschmidt, who takes care of the venue
            and all the local stuff in Berlin.</p>
