				<h1>#mageuc15</h1>

				<p>The first Magento Unconference is over. If we are to believe the replies, it was successful&nbsp;… Because of that, we decided to do it again. So in the near future you will find more information about the #mageUC16 at this place. This year it has been our first time&nbsp;&ndash; and we learned a lot about planning and we hope it will be still better next time. This year it took place in Berlin, in a idyllic location. More or less 90 „Magentos“ have been there and helped to realise that the spirit of an Unconference become alive. Thanks for being there. See you next year!</p>

				<p>So we define our target group as: magento enthusiasts</p>

					<h2>Financial Status</h2>

					<p>We have very great plans for our first unconference. But we also like to get it on track. To achieve that
						we defined some stretch goals for our sponsorships. That said we're having additional comfort at MageUC
						if we can find additional sponsors.</p>

				<h2>Why two types of tickets?</h2>

				<p>Both tickets enable you to attend the full conference with all benefits (wifi, food, drinks as well as party
					and t-shirts if sponsored). For individuals without any magento business we like to share the spirit of
					community by offering a standard ticket price without sending out an invoice. For companies and business
					based attendees we offer the supporter ticket including a regular invoice as PDF for tax authorities.</p>

			<section id="unconference">
				<h2>What is an unConference?</h2>

				<p>Someone said: “An unConference is all about people” and Judith Andresen my UnConference mentor said: “A
					unConference makes the coffee break a principle”. I think now is everything said.</p>

				<p>If you want to know more, here are the details. There are two important parts:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>There are no speakers. You decide what you want you want to hear about and you bring the content.</li>
					<li>We'll have a lot coffee breaks to give even more details, the plan is: 45min session, 30min coffee
						break.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>No speaker</h3>

				<p>We meet in the morning, collect contributions (talks, workshops, tutorials or discussions you can give or
					moderate) and interests (thing you want to hear about, learn or check out).</p>

				<p>All topics are presented in a few sentences and we merge topics which are near, so it may happen, that two
					contribs end in one session and we have great discussions.</p>

				<p>All attendees have two votes to decide what they are interested in. The sessions with the most votes win
					and the time table is built from them.</p>

				<p>Then you will have a great time in the sessions.</p>

				<h3>Coffee breaks</h3>

				<p>We'll take care of the time and bring you all together for 45 minutes, so you can discuss the session you've just
					attend, talk about problems or ideas you have about magento or just meet friends.</p>

				<h2>Our Motivation</h2>

				<img src="groupimage-orga-team.jpg" alt="Orga Team of Mage UC 2015" width="100%"/>
				<p><small>Our Team Vinai, Rico, Fabian, Carmen and Tobias</small></p>
				

				<p>A long time ago, two agencies started the idea of developing modules for the (german) magento community:
					FlagBit and ITABS. From this idea, to give something back to the community, FireGento started as a group of
					agencies and freelancers to develop open source modules. Today we maintain one of the most important modules
					for the german market: FireGento MageSetup, we organize hackathons in germany and switzerland, and help other
					conference organizers around the world with their hackathons. Beside this, a lot modules werde developed by
					our members or friends on hackathons - check them out.</p>

				<p>Because two of our members are part of the PHP unConference Europe, we thought it is a good idea to do a
					magento specific UnConference, because this format gives more space for discussion, knowledge transfer and
					networking than any other conference format, that we know of.</p>

				<h3>Team</h3>

				<p>A big thank you to our team. Rico Neitzel and Tobias Klose which take care of all the marketing
					stuff, website and paper stuff. Vinai Kopp our connection to the community and our gofer. Pia Bodden proof
					reader of all texts. We'll also shout out to Carmen Bremen, who writes a lot of texts for MageUC and Fabian
					Blechschmidt, who takes care of the venue and all the local stuff in Berlin.</p>
