    <section id="about">
        <h1>#mageuc15</h1>

        <p>This is the first magento unconf ever. Since it is an un-conference it is really in your hands what
            happens.
            Are designers, agencies and shop owners interested too in such an (un)conference? We are all
            developers in the orga team, so there will surely be interesting things for “us”.</p>

        <p>We invite you all to come around and bring your topics with you. At least for us the PHPucEU showed that
            developers are highly interested in soft skills. So there will be a cut in the topics which is interesting
            for all - hopefully.</p>

        <p>I can imagine sessions like: - how does the checkout work? - how to explain a customer that it is really
            important to follow the laws with your shop? - how to deploy a magento? - do you put the magento core into
            git (svn,...) too, if not, what then? - how many steps are ideal in the checkout?</p>

        <p>So we define our target group as: magento enthusiasts</p>

            <h2>Financial Status</h2>

            <p>We have very great plans for our first unconference. But we also like to get it on track. To achieve that
                we defined some stretch goals for our sponsorships. That said we're having additional comfort at MageUC
                if we can find additional sponsors.</p>

            <p>Here we'd like to share our current status of these additional funds based on the current level of attendance.</p>

        <h2>Why two types of tickets?</h2>

        <p>Both tickets enable you to attend the full conference with all benefits (wifi, food, drinks as well as party
            and t-shirts if sponsored). For individuals without any magento business we like to share the spirit of
            community by offering a standard ticket price without sending out an invoice. For companies and business
            based attendees we offer the supporter ticket including a regular invoice as PDF for tax authorities.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="unconference">
        <h2>What is an unConference?</h2>

        <p>Someone said: “An unConference is all about people” and Judith Andresen my UnConference mentor said: “A
            unConference makes the coffee break a principle”. I think now is everything said.</p>

        <p>If you want to know more, here are the details. There are two important parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>There are no speakers. You decide what you want you want to hear about and you bring the content.</li>
            <li>We'll have a lot coffee breaks to give even more details, the plan is: 45min session, 30min coffee
                break.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>No speaker</h3>

        <p>We meet in the morning, collect contributions (talks, workshops, tutorials or discussions you can give or
            moderate) and interests (thing you want to hear about, learn or check out).</p>

        <p>All topics are presented in a few sentences and we merge topics which are near, so it may happen, that two
            contribs end in one session and we have great discussions.</p>

        <p>All attendees have two votes to decide what they are interested in. The sessions with the most votes win
            and the timetable is built from them.</p>

        <p>Then you will have a great time in the sessions. Last year a lot sessions were outside on a great green spot
            in front of the institute, while the sun shined.</p>

        <h3>Coffee breaks</h3>

        <p>We'll take care of the time and bring you all 45min together, so you can discuss the session you just
            attend, problems or ideas you have about magento or just meet friends.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="motivation">
        <h2>Our Motivation</h2>

        <p>A long time ago, two agencies started the idea of developing modules for the (german) magento community:
            FlagBit and ITABS. From this idea, to give something back to the community, FireGento started as a group of
            agencies and freelancers to develop open source modules. Today we maintain one of the most important modules
            for the german market: FireGento MageSetup, we organize hackathons in germany and switzerland, and help other
            conference organizers around the world with their hackathons. Beside this, a lot modules werde developed by
            our members or friends on hackathons - check them out.</p>

        <p>Because two of our members are part of the PHP unConference Europe, we thought it is a good idea to do a
            magento specific UnConference, because this format gives more space for discussion, knowledge transfer and
            networking than any other conference format, that we know of.</p>
        <h3>Team</h3>

        <p>A big thank you to our team. Rico Neitzel and Tobias Klose which take care of all the marketing
            stuff, website and paper stuff. Vinai Kopp our connection to the community and our gofer. Pia Bodden proof
            reader of all texts. And Fabian Blechschmidt who takes care of the venue and all the local stuff in
            Berlin.</p>

    <section id="schedule">
        <h2>Current Schedule</h2>
