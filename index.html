					<h2>Financial Status</h2>
					
					<p>We have very great plans for our second unconference. But we also like to get it on track. To achieve that
						we defined some stretch goals for our sponsorships. That said we're having additional comfort at MageUC
						if we can find additional sponsors.</p>
					
					<p>Here we'd like to share our current status of these additional funds based on the current level of attendance.</p>

				<h2>Why two types of tickets?</h2>
			
				<p>Both tickets enable you to attend the full conference with all benefits (wifi, food, drinks as well as party
					and t-shirts if sponsored). For individuals without any magento business we like to share the spirit of
					community by offering a standard ticket price. For companies and business based attendees we offer 
					the supporter ticket. We personally think that it's just fair to support the community you're getting paid for. The thesis is easy: <strong>You earn money with Magento? You should buy a supporter ticket!</strong></p>
			</section>
			<section id="unconference">
				<h2>What is an unConference?</h2>
			
				<p>Someone said: “An unConference is all about people” and Judith Andresen my UnConference mentor said: “A
					unConference makes the coffee break a principle”. I think now is everything said.</p>
			
				<p>If you want to know more, here are the details. There are two important parts:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>There are no speakers. You decide what you want you want to hear about and you bring the content.</li>
					<li>We'll have a lot coffee breaks to give even more details, the plan is: 45min session, 30min coffee
						break.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>No speaker</h3>
			
				<p>We meet in the morning, collect contributions (talks, workshops, tutorials or discussions you can give or
					moderate) and interests (thing you want to hear about, learn or check out).</p>
			
				<p>All topics are presented in a few sentences and we merge topics which are near, so it may happen, that two
					contribs end in one session and we have great discussions.</p>
			
				<p>All attendees have two votes to decide what they are interested in. The sessions with the most votes win
					and the time table is built from them.</p>
			
				<p>Then you will have a great time in the sessions.</p>
			
				<h3>Coffee breaks</h3>
			
				<p>We'll take care of the time and bring you all together for 45 minutes, so you can discuss the session you've just
					attend, talk about problems or ideas you have about magento or just meet friends.</p>

				<h2>Our Motivation</h2>
			
				<img src="2015/groupimage-orga-team.jpg" alt="Orga Team of Mage UC 2015" width="100%"/>
				<p><small>Our Team Vinai, Rico, Fabian, Carmen and Tobias (not there: Sonja and Pia)</small></p>
				
			
				<p>A long time ago, two agencies started the idea of developing modules for the (german) magento community:
					FlagBit and ITABS. From this idea, to give something back to the community, FireGento started as a group of
					agencies and freelancers to develop open source modules. Today we maintain one of the most important modules
					for the german market: FireGento MageSetup, we organize hackathons in germany and switzerland, and help other
					conference organizers around the world with their hackathons. Beside this, a lot modules werde developed by
					our members or friends on hackathons - check them out.</p>
			
				<p>Because two of our members are part of the PHP unConference Europe, we thought it is a good idea to do a
					magento specific UnConference, because this format gives more space for discussion, knowledge transfer and
					networking than any other conference format, that we know of.</p>
			
				<h3>Team</h3>
			
				<p>A big thank you to our team. Rico Neitzel and Tobias Klose which take care of all the marketing
					stuff, website and paper stuff. Vinai Kopp our connection to the community and our gofer. Sonja Riesterer and Carmen Bremen for their social media engagement and Pia Bodden as our proof
					reader of all texts. We'll also shout out to Fabian Blechschmidt, who takes care of the venue and all the local stuff in Berlin.</p>
